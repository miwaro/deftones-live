Who’s the one to say bite the mold uptight\nWhen the body body little chop on the grass hum\nAnd when you think that you can catch it can I get none\nSo on the palm still, sing the same note\nAnd a piece of life is what I need yo\nI’ll just take it, and like take it, shhh\nI can this time\n\nWhen I’m buried under the ashes\nAll the things that I took for granted\nDo you wonder who wrote the story\nAll have faced the same road before me\nLet me ask just one more time\n\nMighty words that try to distract me\nBut its faith that makes us believe thee\nYes I know but that’s not the question\nYour my guide and show me direction\nWhat we do to hold this time\nGo!\n\nOkay! Who’s the one to say bite the mold uptight\nWhen the body body little chop on the grass hum\nAnd when you think that you can catch it can I get none\nSo on the palm still, sing the same note\nAnd a piece of life is what I need yo\nI’ll just take it back and once you see that\nI’m living here in blackness yeah\n\nWill I know until I dig her\nWhen will I know\nWhen will I know"
